## Overview

This project is a responsive web application built to meet the design specifications provided in the Figma file. It demonstrates the implementation of a dynamic, accessible, and SEO-optimized page using React (or Next.js/Gatsby).

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various devices and screen sizes.
- **SEO Optimization**: Semantic HTML structure and relevant meta tags.
- **Accessibility**: Compliance with accessibility standards.
- **Google Tag Manager**: Integrated with Google Analytics for tracking.
- **Dynamic Data**: Fetches and displays data from selected APIs.
- **Pagination and Modal**: Includes "Load more" functionality and modal display for additional information.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
